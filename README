Interactive kenken game.
Web-based, java-script

Idea is as you play you get to define cages
and choose which information (sum, etc.) you
get for each cage.

Sum, product are straightforward.

Difference - how to generalize to cage bigger than 2 squares? There are several
possibilities:
1) Sort the numbers and alternate + and -, giving largest a plus so result is >= 0.
2) Sort and then take the first n of them (i.e. the largest ones) such that 
the sum of the n numbers is greater than the sum of the remaining numbers, 
but the same is not true for n-1. 
Result is (sum of first n) - (sum of remaining numbers).

Division. In standard kenken this is only given for cages with 2 squares, 
and for which on is an integer multiple of the other, 
so division gives an integer. 
In interactive case ...
